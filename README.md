# PyGame.
Dev#4 hackaton Game project that is a 2D runner game.
MVP is a game where the player can walk right, left and jump (like in Mario). You should jump over obstacles and blocks. if you fall or touch spikes - you restart or finish the game.


# Steps of work.
At first our 5 member team had an art task when we had to create some textures for objects in the game like clouds, blocks, sun, snowflakes, rain, snowdrifts, holes and others.

Our team has:
2 artists (so we need 2 artists because we have to create really plenty of textures),
1 programmer (we use python to create the game using PyGame python gamedev library),
2 helpers (helpers assist programmer and artist to work connected, they review code and explain features to programmer).
